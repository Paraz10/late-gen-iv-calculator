This is a IV calculator made to calculate the IV of the Pok√©mon of your choice from his stats.

The source code has been created by wartab. It is avaiable at https://github.com/pokemon-speedrunning/late-gen-iv-calculator.

This is a version I, Paraz10, edited to adapt it to make it generic.

To make it work, you need to fill the stats.txt file following the stats_format.txt file format.

To start it, lunch the iv-calculator file. You need JavaRE to use it.

Enter your stats at the indicated level on the left to reduce the possible IVs of your Pokemon.

You can left/right click on the name of a stat to indicate that it is your +/- stat because of your nature.

If you have a neutral nature, you can click on "Nature" at the bottom to tell it to the calculator.

You can use CTRL + Z to cancel the last thing you imputed to the calculator (Evolution, stat, nature...) (can be
done multiple times in a row, don't always work)
